# Moment Map 

Moment Map is a rack application built on chf-webr, a lightweight ruby web
framework and PostgreSQL ORM. The front end uses React.js and moment data is
managed using the Flux pattern. Static assets are bundled with Webpack and
served using Rack::Static. Using the Google Maps API and a moment API built on
chf-webr, users can create new moments and browse moments by location and tag in
a single- page experience.
